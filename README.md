# Threepenny-gui Context Menu

Note: This package requires the use of a Threepenny-gui fork in which the
`UI.contextmenu` event provides coordinates relative to the page rather than the
containing element.

Write simple nested context menus for threepenny-gui.

Menu items can either be UI actions to run or a nested menu.
